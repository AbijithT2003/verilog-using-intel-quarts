Problem Statement:
To scale down the frequency of 50MHz to 3.125MHz and 195KHz and implement Pulse Width Modulation on it.
 designing a Frequency Scaling and Pulse Width Modulation block which has a 50MHz clock and 4-bit Duty cycle as inputs.  outputs which can generate a variable duty cycle pulse width modulated signal with frequency of 195KHz and 3125KHz clock signal.
